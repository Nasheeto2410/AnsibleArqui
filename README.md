# ü§ñ Ansible Automation ‚Äì LAB-IT-UAI

This directory serves as the foundation for managing and deploying the entire infrastructure of **IT-LAB-UAI** using Ansible. The goal is to ensure that every component in the lab ‚Äî from workstations to network configurations ‚Äî can be consistently provisioned, maintained, and reset using automated playbooks.

By leveraging **Ansible**, we ensure:

- **Consistency** across machines and environments.
- **Repeatability** of installations and setups.
- **Idempotency**, meaning playbooks can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects.
- **Simplicity**, with readable YAML-based playbooks and no need for agents on target machines.

The idea behind this structure is that **everything in the infrastructure should be buildable and recoverable through code**, offering full control and auditability of every stateful change in the LAB.

## üß© Context and Integration

The playbooks in this repository are intended to be used **after the machines have been booted and initialized**, such as through the PXE boot process previously documented.

> üì¶ Reference: [PXE Boot Project Documentation](https://github.com/IT-LAB-UAI/Documentation/blob/main/PXE/README.md)

These playbooks assume that:
- Machines already have a network connection
- An SSH-accessible user (e.g., `lab`) exists, as defined in the PXE setup

Ansible is used at this stage to **apply consistent configurations across all machines**, ensuring that key system states ‚Äî such as installed packages, user setups, or network settings ‚Äî are aligned throughout the LAB environment.

This approach allows for changes to be **propagated horizontally**, reducing manual work and maintaining a reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure.

## üîê Security Considerations

These playbooks are designed to install an **SSH public key** on each target machine to enable passwordless Ansible access in future runs.

Because of this, it is strongly recommended that you deploy these playbooks **from a dedicated control machine inside the LAB** (e.g., the main server), and not from a personal laptop or temporary workstation. Otherwise:

- Your SSH key will be injected into **every machine** listed in the inventory
- All target machines will add your personal machine to their `known_hosts` list

Centralizing Ansible execution ensures tighter control over who has remote access and keeps the automation footprint consistent across the LAB.
